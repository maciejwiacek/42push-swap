## Overview
The main objective is to sort a list of integers in ascending order using a minimal number of operations, showcasing an understanding of data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques. The project is designed to enhance problem-solving skills and efficiency in coding.

## Features
- Implement a sorting algorithm that sorts a list of integers using two stacks (a and b).
- Use a series of defined operations to manipulate the stacks.

## Requirements:
- Sort a list of integers in the least number of operations.
- Implement an efficient algorithm to determine the best moves for sorting.
- Handle edge cases such as duplicate values and already sorted lists.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maciejwiacek/42push-swap.git && cd 42push-swap
```
2. Build the project
```bash
make
```
3. Run the simulation
```bash
./philo [list_of_integers]
```

## Gained Knowledge:
- Develop a deep understanding of stack data structures and their operations.
- Gain experience in algorithm optimization and complex analysis.
- Improve problem-solving skills by implementing and refining sorting strategies.
- Deepen understanding of linked lists.
